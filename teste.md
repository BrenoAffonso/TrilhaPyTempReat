# Industrial Process for Alkylation of Benzene by Propylene to Cumene

## Introduction
Cumene (isopropylbenzene) is produced by the alkylation of benzene with propylene. This is a critical process in the chemical industry as cumene is a precursor to phenol and acetone, which are used in various applications.

## Raw Materials
- **Benzene**: An aromatic hydrocarbon.
- **Propylene**: An alkene (propylene or propene).

## Catalyst
- **Solid Acid Catalyst**: Typically zeolites or phosphoric acid on a silica-alumina support.

## Process Steps

1. **Feed Preparation**:
   - Purify benzene and propylene to remove any impurities that could poison the catalyst.

2. **Reaction**:
   - **Conditions**:
     - **Temperature**: 250-300Â°C.
     - **Pressure**: 20-30 atm.
   - **Reaction**:
     - Benzene and propylene are fed into a reactor in the presence of a solid acid catalyst.
     - The alkylation reaction occurs, forming cumene and some polyalkylated by-products.

3. **Separation and Purification**:
   - **Distillation**: The reaction mixture is subjected to fractional distillation to separate unreacted benzene, cumene, and heavy polyalkylated compounds.
   - **Recycle Streams**: Unreacted benzene is recycled back to the reactor.

4. **Purification of Cumene**:
   - **Fractionation**: Further distillation to achieve high-purity cumene.

## Chemical Reaction
$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_6 + \text{C}_3\text{H}_6 \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{C}_3\text{H}_7
$$

## Advantages
- **High Yield**: Efficient process yielding high amounts of cumene.
- **Catalyst Regeneration**: Modern processes use catalysts that can be easily regenerated.

## Applications
- **Phenol Production**: Cumene is oxidized to cumene hydroperoxide, which is then cleaved to produce phenol and acetone.
- **Acetone Production**: A co-product of phenol synthesis.
